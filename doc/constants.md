# mathematical and physical constants in Xenly

> [!NOTE]
> A mathematical constant is a key number whose value is fixed by an unambiguous definition,
> often referred to by a special symbol (e.g., an alphabet letter), or by mathematicians'
> names to facilitate using it across multiple mathematical problems. Constants arise in
> many areas of mathematics, with constants such as e and π occurring in such diverse
> contexts as geometry, number theory, statistics, and calculus.

| Constant           | Description                              |
|:-------------------|:-----------------------------------------|
| `pi` or `π`        | The number π is a mathematical constant that is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, approximately equal to 3.14159.                       |
| `e`                | The number e is a mathematical constant, approximately equal to 2.71828, that is the base of the natural logarithm.                                              |
| `tau` or `τ`       | A mathematical constant that is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its radius. This produces a number, and that number is always the same.          |
| `goldenRatio`      | The golden ratio, also known as the golden number, golden proportion, or the divine proportion, is a ratio between two numbers that equals approximately 1.618. |
| `silverRatio`      | The numerical value of the silver ratio is approximately 2.414                                                           |

| `supergoldenRatio` | A geometrical proportion close to 85/58. Its true value is the real solution of the equation x³ = x² + 1.                                                       |

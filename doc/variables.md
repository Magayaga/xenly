# `var` and `let` keywords in Xenly

A variable provides us with named storage that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in Xenly has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory. A variable can store the range of values within that memory or the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.

Variables are statically types means once they are declared with a certain type, then their type cannot be changed, only their value can be changed.

## Declaring Xenly Variables

A variable declaration tells the compiler where and how much to create the storage for the variable. They are always declared before their use and they are declared using the var keyword.

```swift
var variable_name = value
let variable_name = value
```

**For Example**, Xenly program to demonstrate how to declare variables.

1. Numbers
```swift
var number = 42
let pi = 3.14159
print(number)
print(pi)
```

2. Strings
```swift
var string = "United States"
print(string)
```

## (2023 - present): Started development of Xenly

* Xenon was designed on August 23, 2023, by Cyril John Magayaga, a 15-year-old Filipino student and developer. Xenon is influenced by C (Static typing and run-time efficiency) and Go (strong typing and concurrent computing). Its designers were primarily motivated by their shared **dislike of C++**.

* On August 26, 2023, He announced a new programming language, the dense and multiverse, and the successor of the C programming language.

* On November 25, 2023, He announced a closed-source or proprietary software of Xenon programming language.

* On December 22, 2023, He announced that updating and fixing the Xenly programming language files use the `.xe` file extension. Xenly is the Philippines' most popular and best programming language. He was very good at mathematics such as algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, analysis, and more branches of mathematics. After night, He announced that Xenly programming language is the new high-level, fast, and general-purpose programming language.

* On December 26, 2023, He announced that **Xenon** was renamed to **Xenly**, the updating and fixing programming language.

* On December 27, 2023, He announced updating and fixing the Xenly programming language's features.

* On January 26, 2024, He announced that Xenly’s documents, design, implementation, and related tools are hosted on GitHub under the MIT License with GCC and LLVM Exceptions.

* On January 30, 2024, He announced that the Xenly programming language was inspired by the **C** programming language and other influences including **Rust** programming language next year. Later, He announced that the Rust programming language is a command-line interface and the **C** programming language is mainly statements and functions.

* On February 10, 2024, He announced that the Xenly programming language was written in **C** and **Rust** programming languages are the same.

* On February 24, 2024, He wrote **“I think beta version of the Xenly programming language next year”**. Xenly programming language was worked on GCC compiler but not TinyCC and Clang compilers are all fixing warnings.

* On February 29, 2024, He announced that the updates and features of Xenly programming language is the first leap day of the following compiled high-level programming language.

* On March 2, 2024, He announced that the fixing errors and bugs of the Xenly programming language but checking compilers and interpreters.

* On March 9, 2024, He announced that the Xenly programming language for fixing features of **Linux** and **Windows** operating systems.

* On March 27, 2024, He was sick due to cough, headache, and dry nose.

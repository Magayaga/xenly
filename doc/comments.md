# Comments in Xenly

Comments can be used to explain code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.

Comments can be **singled-lined** or **multi-lined**.

## Example code

```swift
// This is singled-lined
print("Hello, World")
```

Multi-line comments start with `/*` and ends with `*/`.

Any text between `/*` and `*/` will be ignored by the compiler:

```swift
/*
  This is multi-lined
  "Hello, World" program
*/
print("Hello, World!")
```

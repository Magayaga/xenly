**Xenly** (formerly known as **Xenon**) is a **free and open-source** compiled high-level, multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language designed primarily for command-line interfaces, web servers, and applications. It was originally written in **C**, **Go**, and **Rust** programming languages. It was created and developed by [Cyril John Magayaga](https://github.com/magayaga), who is best known for creating [Hyzero](https://github.com/magayaga/hyzero) programming language, [Nanomath](https://github.com/magayaga/nanomath) command-based scientific and programming calculator, and [Concat](https://github.com/magayaga/concat) command-based concatenate and print files.

Xenly programming language should be command-line interfaces, web servers, and desktop applications. It is static and dynamic typing, readability, usability, and flexibility.

## Examples
### Hello, World! program
The following shows how a **"Hello, World!"** program is written in Xenly programming language:

```swift
// “Hello, World!” program
print("Hello, World!")
```

A **Xenly** variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

```swift
// "var" variable to print()
var hi = "Hello, World!"
print(hi)
```

I know all high-level programming languages like **Python**, **Ruby**, **Lua**, and **Julia** were initially written in C programming language.

The following shows how a **"Hello, World!"** program is written in [Hyzero](https://github.com/magayaga/Hyzero) programming language:

```python
# “Hello, World!” program
write("Hello, World!")
```

A **Hyzero** variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
```python
# "VAR" variable to print()
VAR hi = "Hello, World!"
print(hi)
```

Here is the Hyzero programming language that was initially written in Python programming language like interpreter, high-level, and functional.

## Source Code Organization

The Xenly source code is organized as follows:

|          Directory           |                           Contents                          |

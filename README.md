<h1 align="center">Xenly programming language</h1>

**Xenly** (formerly known as **Xenon**) is a high-level, multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language designed primarily for command-line interfaces, web servers, and applications. It was originally written in **C programming language** and created and developed by [Cyril John Magayaga](https://github.com/magayaga), who is best known for the creating [Hyzero](https://github.com/magayaga/hyzero) programming language, [Nanomath](https://github.com/magayaga/nanomath) command-based scientific and programming calculator, and [Concat](https://github.com/magayaga/concat) command-based concatenate and print files.

Xenly programming language should be command-line interfaces, web servers, and desktop applications. It is static and dynamic typing, readability, usability, and flexibility.

### Hello, World! program
The following shows how a **"Hello, World!"** program is written in Xenly programming language:

```c
// “Hello, World!” program
print("Hello, World!")
```

I know all high-level programming languages like **Python**, **Ruby**, **Lua**, and **Julia** were initially written in C programming language.

The following shows how a **"Hello, World!"** program is written in Hyzero programming language:

```python
# “Hello, World!” program
write("Hello, World!")
```

Here is the Hyzero programming language that was initially written in Python programming language like interpreter, high-level, and functional.

In chemistry, **Xenon** is a chemical element; it has symbol **Xe** and atomic number **54**. It is a dense, colorless, odorless noble gas found in Earth's atmosphere in trace amounts.

### Getting started

1. **Debian or Ubuntu** operating systems:
   ```shell

   # Update apt
   $ sudo apt update

   # Install tools; Choose the Clang or GCC
   $ sudo apt install gcc git
   $ sudo apt install clang git

   # Download Xenly's code
   $ git clone https://github.com/magayaga/xenly.git
   $ cd xenly
   ```

   Then you can build and run the code:
   ```shell
   # Clang
   $ clang sources/xenly.c -o xenly

   # GCC
   $ gcc sources/xenly.c -o xenly
   ```

   Last, Open the application:
   ```shell
   ./xenly
   ```

2. **Windows** operating system:

   Choose the [**MinGW Installer**](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/), [**Cygwin**](https://www.cygwin.com/), or [**MSYS2**](https://www.msys2.org/) on Windows operating system. After, the download the [Git on Windows](https://git-scm.com/).

   ```shell
   # Download Xenly's code
   $ git clone https://github.com/magayaga/xenly.git
   $ cd xenly
   ```

   Then you can build and run the code:
   ```shell
   # Clang
   $ clang sources/xenly.c -o xenly

   # GCC
   $ gcc sources/xenly.c -o xenly
   ```

   Last, Open the application:
   ```shell
   ./xenly
   ```
   
## History

Xenon was designed on August 23, 2023, by Cyril John Magayaga, a 15-year-old Filipino student and developer. Xenon is influenced by C (Static typing and run-time efficiency) and Go (strong typing and concurrent computing). Its designers were primarily motivated by their shared **dislike of C++**.

On August 26, 2023, He announced a new programming language, the dense and multiverse, and the successor of the C programming language.

On November 25, 2023, He announced a closed-source or proprietary software of Xenon programming language.

On December 22, 2023, He announced that updating and fixing the Xenly programming language files use the `.xe` file extension. Xenly is Asia's most popular and best programming language. He was very good at mathematics such as algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, analysis, and more branches of mathematics. After night, He announced that Xenly programming language is the new high-level, fast, and general-purpose programming language.

On December 26, 2023, He announced that **Xenon** was renamed to **Xenly**, the updating and fixing programming language.

On December 27, 2023, He announced updating and fixing the Xenly programming language's features.

# Xenly programming language

**Xenly** (formerly known as **Xenon**) is a high-level, multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language designed primarily for command-line interfaces, web servers, and applications. It was originally written in **C programming language** and created and developed by [Cyril John Magayaga](https://github.com/magayaga), who is best known for the creating [Hyzero](https://github.com/magayaga/hyzero) programming language, [Nanomath](https://github.com/magayaga/nanomath) command-based scientific and programming calculator, and [Concat](https://github.com/magayaga/concat) command-based concatenate and print files.

Xenly programming language should be command-line interfaces, web servers, and desktop applications. It is static and dynamic typing, readability, usability, and flexibility.

### Hello, World! program
The following shows how a **"Hello, World!"** program is written in Xenon programming language:

```c
// “Hello, World!” program
print("Hello, World!")
```

I know all high-level programming languages like Python, Ruby, Lua, and Julia were initially written in C programming language.

The following shows how a **"Hello, World!"** program is written in Hyzero programming language:

```python
# “Hello, World!” program
write("Hello, World!")
```

Here is the Hyzero programming language that was initially written in Python programming language like interpreter, high-level, and functional.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Download the Xenly's source code
$ git clone https://github.com/xenly xenly-pre-linux
$ cd xenly-pre-linux
$ git checkout pre-linux

# Compile and run
$ make
$ bash main.sh

# Open the xenly programming language compiler
$ ./xenly examples/print/main.xe
```
